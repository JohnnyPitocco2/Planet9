# Planet9
Python program which analyzes South Pole Telescope data, using  a shift and stack method, to detect distant solar system objects below the single exposure limit in order to discover a new Neptune-sized planet in the distant solar system

Working Files are:
- workflow_weighted.py (the main function to run a search for planet 9 candidates in this file is "everything([parameters])")


NOTE: The south pole telescope maps are massively large and size, and also that data isn't mine, thus the maps necessary to run this program are not on this github.
